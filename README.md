# TODO
1. Implement DLT: Done.
2. Implement Normalised DLT: Done
3. Implement RANSAC without Normalisation: Done
Implement NormaliseValues function. Done
3. Implement RANSAC with Normalisation: Done
4. Test how long variants of my method take to find a solution.
5. Test how many inlier correspondences are found in the RANSAC process with each variant.
6. Test how iterations does the RANSAC process need to find a good solution, and how many does this differ among the variants.
7. How accurately do the variants of my method estimate the homography?
